# COVID Care
## Reimagining the health checkup procedures in post covid era

### The problem it solves
1. Provides an instant report of a person's pulse rate, oxygen levels and body temperature.
2. Access your health records at a public check-in on the mobile app.
3. Maintains a database of the health of all the people checking in at a public place.
4. Sends alert in case of adverse changes in health parameters.
5.  The user of the mobile app can also add health records.

### Challenges we ran into
1.  Because we did simulation online we were not able to find the libraries of some sensors and hence, could not include them in our device.
2. We faced difficulty with integrating Wi-fi and Bluetooth functionality in our device.

### Technologies we used
`Arduino Uno`, `Proteus`,`I2C communication protocol`,`tmp36`,`pulse sensor`
